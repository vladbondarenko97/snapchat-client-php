# snapchat-client-php
A full featured Snapchat web client (using the old Snapchat API) in PHP. 

This was a project that I ended up completing, however it does not work anymore due to the security of Snapchat's API, they blocked all the API access. The interface was very similar to Snapchat's. I had recreated all the icons (opened/unopened/video/screenshot/etc).

Features:
View all unopened snaps/videos, mark as read, add new friends, look at friends, see best friends, view all stories, compose new snaps w/ flash player PC camera integration, beautiful interface.

Note, this script is not maintained any more, this used to be a project in 2014-2015.
